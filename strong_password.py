- It contains at least one lowercase English character.
- It contains at least one uppercase English character.
- It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+

She typed a random string of length n in the password field. Given the string she typed, can you find the minimum number of characters she must add to make her password strong?

Function Description

Complete the minimumNumber function.

minimumNumber has the following parameters:
- int n: the length of the password
- string password: the password to test

Returns
- int: the minimum number of characters to add

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the length of the password.
The second line contains the password string. Each character is either a lowercase/uppercase English alphabet, a digit, or a special character.

- 1 <= n <= 100
- All characters in password are in [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or [!@#$%^&*()-+]
